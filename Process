# Here's an overview of the steps involved:

- Creating an S3 Bucket:Create a new bucket on Amazon S3 to store the IMDB datasets obtained from Kaggle.
- Setting Up an EMR Cluster: Launch an EMR cluster on AWS to enable the execution of Jupyter Notebook with PySpark support.
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook for Analysis: Create a new Jupyter Notebook within the EMR cluster to perform the data analysis.Configuring the Notebook Kernel to PySpark:
- Configure the notebook kernel to use PySpark for running Spark jobs.
- Installing Required Packages:Install any necessary packages or dependencies required for the analysis, such as pyspark, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
- Running Analysis on the Datasets:Utilize PySpark functions to conduct various analyses on the IMDB datasets.

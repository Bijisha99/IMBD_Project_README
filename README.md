In this project, we aim to analyze the IMDB datasets sourced from Kaggle. We'll leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, specifically S3 for storing the datasets, EMR for running Spark jobs, and Jupyter Notebook for executing PySpark functions to conduct our analysis. 
# Here's an overview of the steps involved:

- Creating an S3 Bucket:Create a new bucket on Amazon S3 to store the IMDB datasets obtained from Kaggle.
- Setting Up an EMR Cluster: Launch an EMR cluster on AWS to enable the execution of Jupyter Notebook with PySpark support.
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook for Analysis: Create a new Jupyter Notebook within the EMR cluster to perform the data analysis.Configuring the Notebook Kernel to PySpark:
- Configure the notebook kernel to use PySpark for running Spark jobs.
- Installing Required Packages:Install any necessary packages or dependencies required for the analysis, such as pyspark, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
- Running Analysis on the Datasets:Utilize PySpark functions to conduct various analyses on the IMDB datasets.
